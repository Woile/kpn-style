# Usage
Buttons communicate the action that will occur when the user touches them. Keep titles short. Overly long text can crowd your interface and may get truncated on smaller screens.

There are 3 standard types of buttons: primary, secondary and text links (hyperlinks) Available in formats: small, standard and large

## Primary button
The primary button is used for the most important action in page. We consider the most important action to be what lies in the expectation of the user. Actions such as: Bestel, Info & bestel, Zoek, Verder, Opslaan, Verzenden etc.
